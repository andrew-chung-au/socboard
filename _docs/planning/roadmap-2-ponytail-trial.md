# Roadmap 2: Ponytail trial

Order and status only. Method and criteria: `_docs/planning/ponytail-trial-protocol.md`. Decision (approved): `_docs/decisions/2026-11-06T0024Z-ponytail-trial.md`.

- **Status:** next (Core is now; the baseline runs on Core issues from #2 onward)
- **Goal:** Learn whether, and for which function, ponytail improves how this project's agents work, measured against our own baseline.
- **Tasks, in order** (file as issues when groomed; numbers added then):
  1. Human habit, starting now: record tool and model on every `Launch usage` line. The `Assisted-by` commit line is already required.
  2. Settle every process edit before the first baseline issue is groomed: a later change that could alter a control issue starts a new epoch.
  3. (#23) Phase 1 plumbing: hold the pinned `ponytail-review` file verbatim at a path no tool auto-discovers (not `.claude/skills/`, `.opencode/skills/`, `.kiro/skills/` or `.agents/skills/`; OpenCode reads the first and last too), for the reviewer role to load by path. Confirm each tool you use can read it. Keep the core `ponytail` skill out of the repo for now. Both skills' descriptions can trigger on ordinary work, which would contaminate control issues.
  4. (#24) Metrics script and make target, computing every figure from git and GitHub only.
  5. (#25) Reviewer role: one role file, thin pointers in each tool, read-only; `make assert-clean` after each run.
  6. Phase 1: baseline plus shadow review on at least 5 qualifying issues; gate review at the sweep.
  7. Phase 2, after the gate: install the core `ponytail` skill where tools discover it, only in tools that passed, and add the `ponytail: on` rule to AGENTS.md (protected). Then Phase 3 as the protocol says.
- **Not in this phase:** installing any ponytail plugin; scope, debt-ledger and audit functions (each needs its own trial after the first two are decided).
- **Archive when:** the Phase 3 gate decision record exists.
