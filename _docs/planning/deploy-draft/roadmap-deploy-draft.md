# Roadmap: Deploy (draft v3, Terraform on AWS)

PM proposal only. Nothing is filed and no tracked file is edited. Replaces v2. Questions and spec notes: `.scratch/readiness-and-questions-v3.md`.

Order and status only. Acceptance criteria live on the issues. Scope and reasons: `_docs/specs.md` §6 (outline only). Method: `_docs/planning/03_deployment.md` (course material for this project, followed here).

- **Status:** later (starts when Core ends). **Provisional:** the spec's Deploy part has no journey and no requirements yet, so no issue below is filed until the human approves the spec notes and the deploy decision record.
- **Goal:** SOCBoard runs from one container image with Postgres, starts with one Docker Compose command, is covered by integration and end-to-end tests, is reachable at a public HTTPS URL on AWS created by Terraform, and is deployed by CI/CD only when the tests pass.
- **Reference:** the human's earlier project informed the choice of Terraform on AWS and the lessons below. The design here is derived from SOCBoard's spec, the course brief, SOCBoard's code and public documentation of the tools.
- **Who:** **CI** = GitHub Actions can run it; **Human** = needs the human (AWS account, `terraform apply`, GitHub settings, secrets); **Eng** = the Engineer in the sandbox (no Docker, Terraform, AWS credentials or push).

## SOCBoard's Deploy design, and why

- **Terraform on AWS.** The course brief asks for infrastructure as code so the environment is repeatable; Terraform is widely documented and the human chose it on 2026-11-12.
- **One small server running Docker Compose.** SOCBoard is one image plus Postgres, which the brief says suits any host. One server keeps cost and moving parts low for a single environment. Managed database and scaling are named in the brief as later steps.
- **One image.** FastAPI serves the built SPA, so there is no second web server container. Caddy in front only terminates TLS and proxies to the app.
- **Remote state in a private, versioned, encrypted S3 bucket.** State holds resource details and must survive the laptop. The bucket is created first with local state, then state is moved into it.
- **Keyless CI through GitHub OIDC.** The brief asks for short-lived scoped credentials. Separate roles for plan (read-only), apply and deploy, each trusted only for this repository and a named GitHub Environment. Trust uses the repository's numeric ids so a renamed or recreated repository cannot reuse the role.
- **The role definitions are applied only by the human.** CI must not be able to widen its own permissions.
- **Secrets in AWS Secrets Manager.** Terraform stores only the secret's name. The server's instance role reads the value at deploy time, so no secret is in Git, the image, the bundle, Terraform state or GitHub.
- **Access through AWS Systems Manager only.** No SSH key and no port 22; the security group opens 80 and 443. CI deploys by sending a command through Systems Manager.
- **Images in the public GitHub Container Registry**, pushed with the workflow's own token. Because the repository is public, the host needs no registry login.
- **Free hostname with TLS.** A hostname derived from the server's Elastic IP through a public wildcard-DNS service, certificate issued by Caddy automatically (ACME). Chosen on cost and simplicity; a purchased domain is the alternative (question 4).
- **Persistent data on its own encrypted EBS volume with scheduled snapshots**, and Postgres files kept on that volume so snapshots cover the database.
- **Cost guard:** an AWS budget alert, and a documented teardown.
- **Requirements that follow from SOCBoard itself:**
  - In deployed mode the app refuses to start if any secret is missing; there is no default password.
  - The image binds a non-loopback address only through an explicit opt-in; `make backend-run` keeps refusing one (`AGENTS.md`).
  - `/api/health` stays database-free (`openapi.yaml`), so start order uses the Postgres health check.
  - Seeded passwords and the ingest key are deployment secrets, not repository content.
  - Reviewers get credentials out of band, not in the README.
  - Nothing is proven until a real apply; Eng cannot run `plan`/`apply`, so CI runs `fmt` and `validate` and the human runs the first apply.
  - Postgres must keep exactly one owner under simultaneous claims (spec §5).
  - Every cloud resource carries the tag `project=socboard`, and IAM conditions use it.

## Tasks, in order (proposed issues, one deliverable each)

1. **Record the deploy decision (Terraform on AWS).** Heavy decision record: single server, region, state backend, CI authentication and what CI may apply, secrets, TLS hostname, accepted risks. Who: Human decides; PM drafts.
2. **Serve the built frontend from FastAPI.** Screen routes return the SPA entry page; unknown `/api/*` still returns the JSON 404 `not_found`. Needs: #10, #21, #27. Who: Eng; CI.
3. **Read configuration from the environment.** Database URL, ingest key, seeded passwords and poll interval from env vars, with `.env.example`; a missing secret stops start-up in deployed mode. Needs: #11, #13, #14. Who: Eng; CI.
4. **Run on Postgres.** Backend and migrations work on Postgres chosen by the database URL; SQLite stays the local default. Adds a driver dependency (approval first). Needs: #11. Who: Eng; CI with a Postgres service container.
5. **Prove single ownership on Postgres.** Two simultaneous claims leave exactly one owner. Needs: #16, task 4. Who: Eng; CI.
6. **Let the container bind a non-loopback address safely.** Explicit opt-in set only by the image; the refusal for `make backend-run` stays and is tested. Needs: #10, #80. Who: Eng; Human approves the protected-file change.
7. **Build one container image.** Multi-stage `Dockerfile`: build the frontend, copy `frontend/dist` into a non-root Python image. Needs: #21, #27, tasks 2, 3, 6. Who: Eng writes; CI builds; Human checks once locally.
8. **Add the Compose stack.** `docker-compose.yaml` with the app, a one-shot migration step and Postgres (health check, named volume), plus one `make` target. Needs: #22, tasks 4, 7. Who: Eng; CI or Human runs.
9. **Integration tests against the Compose stack.** Frontend served, backend reaches Postgres, login, ingest and queue work. Needs: #14, #15, #22, task 8. Who: Eng; CI.
10. **End-to-end test of both journeys.** Browser test with two analysts and a Lead: claim, refused second claim, close with a reason, audit-trail read. New browser-test tool (approval). Needs: #17, #19, #21, #22, task 8. Who: Eng; CI.
11. **CI builds the image and runs integration and E2E tests.** Unit tests in parallel, then image build, then integration and E2E, beside `make verify`. Needs: tasks 9, 10. Who: Eng; CI.
12. **Terraform: state bucket.** Private, versioned, encrypted S3 bucket, applied once then state migrated; `.gitignore` for state and real variable files, example variable file tracked. Needs: task 1. Who: Eng writes; Human applies.
13. **Terraform: CI access.** OIDC provider, plan role, apply role (Environment `infra`), deploy role (Environment `deploy`), trust on repository ids, narrowly scoped Systems Manager send-command permission, no stored keys. Human-applied only. Needs: tasks 1, 12. Who: Eng writes; Human applies and creates the GitHub Environments.
14. **Terraform: server.** EC2 instance with no key pair, Elastic IP, security group (80, 443), instance role (Systems Manager plus read of the named secrets), encrypted data volume with snapshots holding Postgres files, bootstrap installing Docker, Compose and Caddy, budget alert, `project=socboard` tag. Needs: tasks 1, 12. Who: Eng writes; Human applies.
15. **CI: Terraform checks and plan.** On pull requests touching `terraform/`: `fmt -check`, `init -backend=false`, `validate` without credentials, then a read-only `plan` shown on the PR. No role for forks. Needs: tasks 12, 13, 14. Who: Eng; CI.
16. **First apply by the human.** Checklist: AWS account and budget alert, GitHub Environments (`infra`: reviewer approval needed, administrators not exempt), apply the three parts in order, create the secret, note the IP and hostname, re-run `plan` and expect no changes. Who: **Human**; Eng drafts.
17. **Deploy script and first deploy.** Server-side script run through Systems Manager: pull the image by tag, read the secret with the instance role, write the env file with restrictive permissions, run Compose, reload Caddy; if the image cannot be fetched, the current release keeps serving. The human runs the first deploy and the HTTPS URL loads. Needs: #22, tasks 1, 7, 8, 16. Who: **Human** first run; Eng writes.
18. **Post-deploy smoke check.** A `make` target that, given a URL, checks `/api/health`, login, one ingest, and that the alert reaches the queue within 5 s. Needs: #13, #14, #15. Who: Eng; CI and Human run it.
19. **Deploy from CI on a green push to `main`.** Deploy only after all tests pass, using the OIDC deploy role; record image tag and digest in the job summary; run the smoke check; Terraform apply from CI only for the server part, on `main`, after the human approves the plan. Needs: tasks 11, 15, 17, 18. Who: Eng writes; **Human** sets variables and approves; CI runs.
20. **Write the deploy and teardown runbook.** How to deploy, where the URL is, how reviewers get credentials, the requirements above, and ordered deletion of every cloud resource (server, then CI access, then snapshots and secrets, state bucket last). Needs: tasks 16, 19. Who: Eng; Human performs the teardown when wanted.

- **Needs the human:** 1, 6, 7 (local Docker check), 12 to 14 (apply), 16, 17 (first run), 19 (variables, approval), 20 (teardown). **CI can run:** 2 to 5, 7 to 11, the checks and plan in 15, 18, and the pipeline in 19.
- **Not in this phase:** separate dev and production environments, promotion and rollback (DevOps, `_docs/planning/04_devops.md`); metrics, tracing, alerting; managed or replicated database, autoscaling, load balancing, high availability; custom domain; scheduled server stop; synthetic alert generator and Lead reassignment (Should-haves); Target Enhancements.
- **Archive when:** the public URL serves the app, the Compose `make` target starts the full system, `terraform plan` on `main` shows no changes after the human's apply, and a passing push to `main` deploys without manual steps.
