# Epoch batch: exact kit edits, drafted by the PM (proposal only)

Nothing tracked was edited; nothing was commented on or labelled. Every diff is a file in this folder and is also shown inline below, so this README is enough to review the batch. Kit files are protected: an agent commits each diff with `HUMAN_APPROVED=1` only after the human has approved it.

Human rulings of 2026-11-12 (this session) are applied: items 5, 6, 6b and 7 approved; 2a rewritten as the pointer variant; 3 and 4 left as drafted, with the wording marked as the PM's.

- **Base:** `origin/main` = `2c77a6f` (fetched). The working tree is on branch `session-summary-issue-74` at `999a410`, behind `origin/main` by #74's `openapi.yaml` and two test files only. `git diff --stat HEAD origin/main` over `_docs/agent-kit`, `agent-kit.conf`, `AGENTS.md` is empty, so the patches apply the same to the tree and to `origin/main`.
- **Checks run** (`apply-check.sh`, `check-batch.py`, both read-only, in this folder; re-run 2026-11-12 after rewriting 2a): `git status --short` was empty before and after; `git apply --check` on each patch against the tree passed (output below); `check-batch.py` applied each patch in memory to the `origin/main` blob and counted words (`len(text.split())`, equal to `wc -w`).
- **Not checked:** patches that touch the same file (2a and 4 on `process.md`; 2c and 3 on `qa-engineer.md`; 6 and 7 on `agent-kit.conf`) were each checked alone against the original, not applied in sequence. Their hunks are far apart (git handles the line offset), so I expect them to stack, but I did not prove it. I did not run `make contract-check`, `make verify` or the tests (Kiro Web, no package index).

## Table

Words are `wc -w` of the whole file, before (`origin/main`) and after. "Epoch" is the Amendment 2 test (`_docs/planning/ponytail-trial-protocol.md`, line 105): the change alters what an existing command a role runs does, or adds or changes a rule sentence a role reads. `KIT_VERSION` alone does not.

## Notes for the human

- **#75 and `LINT_CMD` (item 6).** Wiring `make contract-check` into `LINT_CMD` is the approved interim. When #75's lint target arrives, move the contract check out of `LINT_CMD` (or fold it into that target) and regenerate patch 6 and the 6b wording if needed. Cost of the interim: the gate is labelled "Lint" in `make verify` output and in QA's "lint / type check" line.
- **Roadmap line is out of date.** `_docs/planning/roadmap-1-core.md` line 39 says only #63, #49 and #65 move the epoch. #80 also moves it (it changes what `make backend-run` and `make backend-stop` do). The orchestrator fixes the roadmap; I did not touch it.
- **2c withdrawal condition has not triggered.** The condition is a Medium defect after a second-launch PASS. The only second-launch PASS so far is #9's, and no Medium defect has been found since (human statement, 2026-11-12; I did not re-check #10's QA comments myself).
- **Items 3 and 4:** wording chosen by the PM; the human reads the exact diff at landing. Item 3 does not say what "not run" does to the verdict, because #42 does not say. Item 4 uses the generic "agreed order", not the roadmap path, and leaves out the steering file's check at each decision point and the `[groomed]` title prefix.

### 2a. Launch-message checklist, pointer variant (`2a-launch-message-checklist.patch`)

Rewritten per the ruling: no word-for-word Reflection quote; it points to `_docs/agent-kit/procedures/session-summary.md` (Reflection), line 12, which holds the three questions (what slowed you down; what nearly went wrong or was blocked; one proposed change). The proposal's "never ask for a heading that replaces the required line" and "label after it" clauses stay dropped; QA's file already says the comment starts with the verdict.

 2. The PM grooms it, even if it is not yet labelled, when it is owner-authored (`AGENTS.md`, Issues). Groom only the next issue in the agreed order, not a second unlabelled issue while the first waits for the label. The PM's comment records the body hash. Then the human reads the groomed text and adds `approved`; the Engineer starts only after that. If the human changes the text, the orchestrator has the PM record the new hash in a new `PM:` comment before the label is added. Never skip this step. By default (no tier label and no raising proposal is Standard) the PM grooms in full, and the grooming comment carries the `Proposed tier:` line. Only when the human has said the issue is meant to be Light does the PM do the short launch instead (hash record and proposal, no rewrite of the body; see Tiers). The orchestrator reads the effective tier but never decides one.

### 6. Contract check in verify (`6-contract-check-in-verify.patch`) — approved via `LINT_CMD` for now

`make verify` runs `_docs/agent-kit/scripts/verify.sh`, which runs `TEST_CMD`, then `LINT_CMD`, then `TYPECHECK_CMD` from `agent-kit.conf`, so this needs no change to the kit script, the `Makefile` or `verify.sh`. Rejected alternatives: `TEST_CMD="make test && make contract-check"` (hides it in the test line); a `Makefile` dependency on `verify` (edits a second protected file); editing `verify.sh` (a kit file, so a local deviation). To be moved when #75's lint target arrives.

CI needs nothing else: `.github/workflows/verify.yml` runs `make install` (`uv sync --locked --all-groups`, which installs the dev group holding `openapi-spec-validator`) and then `make verify`, which will now run `make contract-check` (`uv run --locked openapi-spec-validator openapi.yaml`). The pre-push hook and push check also run `make verify` (not run here). Before landing, the human runs `make contract-check` and `make verify BASE=origin/main` once in the dev container (#74's summary records a passing `make contract-check` there, but not at the batch commit).

### 7. KIT_VERSION (`7-kit-version.patch`) — approved

The base `1.10` names the parent agent kit and stays; only the local counter `<n>` moves, keeping the `<base>+<repo>.<n>` notation that `kit-check.py` requires. `make kit-check` (run earlier, exit 1 as expected for a derivative) accepts any `+socboard.<n>` whose base is right, so the bump is for the record, not for the check; the kit README (line 106) and `procedures/kit-import.md` (line 29) say `<n>` rises with each local change on the same base. Land it last, after all kit edits and the kit-script issues, so it is written once; then run `make kit-check` and expect the same "claim is correct" line with a longer modified list. I did not check whether earlier local changes (for example `17e725e`) already bumped it.

### 8. Light tier for docs-only changes (`8-light-allowed.patch`) — human ruling of 2026-11-12: option 1, the narrow list

Sets `LIGHT_ALLOWED` in `agent-kit.conf` (protected) to `_docs/planning/roadmap-*.md`, `_docs/planning/epoch-batch-*/*.md` and `_docs/runbooks/*.md`, so a small edit to a roadmap, an epoch-batch note or a runbook can pass `make tier-check TIER=light`. The trial protocol, `rubric.md`, `task.md`, records, session summaries and the spec stay outside the list. Source: the delivery-pace ruling (`.kiro/steering/delivery-pace.md`, item 5) and the human's choice of option 1. Words 359 to 363 (+4).

- **Pattern syntax:** a bash glob tested with `[[ "$path" == $pattern ]]` (`_docs/agent-kit/scripts/lib.sh`); `*` crosses `/`. A `.patch` or `.gitattributes` in an epoch-batch folder does not match `*.md`. `_docs/planning/deploy-draft/*` does not match either.
- **Limits:** `LIGHT_MAX_LINES` stays 20 and counts untracked files, so Light fits small edits to existing files, not new documents. The escalation list (`Makefile`, `agent-kit.conf`, CI, hooks, scripts, test files) always wins.
- **Checks (PM, 2026-11-12):** the patch applies alone and after items 6 and 7 in the order 6, 7, 8 on a copy of `origin/main`'s `agent-kit.conf`; a pattern check passes the four example roadmap, epoch-batch and runbook files and leaves the protocol, rubric, task, a patch file, a summary, a record and the spec outside.
- **Epoch (Amendment 2):** not a move: it changes `make tier-check TIER=light`'s result only for those paths, and roles run it only on Light issues, which are not control issues. A strict reading could count it; it lands in the batch either way, so the cost is nil.
- Light still needs its own `approved` issue and the human's `tier:light` label (`process.md`, Tiers).

## Epoch effect

Under Amendment 2 every item above except 7 (and 6b on its own) moves the epoch, and so do #63, #49, #65 and #80. The epoch moves once if all of them are on `main`, with the epoch-start record written, before the first counted issue launches. Nothing here moves it by itself while the batch is held back.

## Proposed landing order

Precondition: #11 is closed and its session summary is merged (the fifth qualifying control issue; `_docs/planning/roadmap-1-core.md`, line 39). No counted issue is claimed until step 6. Re-run `bash .scratch/epoch-batch/apply-check.sh` before each protected commit: #63, #49 and #65 edit kit scripts and `agent-kit.conf`, and may shift lines.

1. **#63** (Engineer, QA): `make issue-close` ignores reflection-only Engineer comments. First, because the roadmap holds Reflection hashes back until it lands, and patch 2a asks for Reflections on every issue. It edits a kit script, so it is protected.
2. **Doc edits 1, 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d, 3, 4, 5** (no Engineer or QA work; the human approves each exact diff; one `HUMAN_APPROVED=1` commit each, or one commit for the lot if the human prefers). Landing them before #65, #49 and #80 means those issues run under the new launch checklist, the stopping rule and the unrun-checks list. If the human wants the plumbing issues run under the old text instead, move this step after step 5; the epoch still moves once.
3. **#65 then #49** (Engineer, QA, both Heavy, together as the roadmap says): the CI base in `.github/workflows/verify.yml` first, then the markers in `verify.sh`, `verify.md` and `agent-kit.conf` (`TEST_FILES`). #65 first so that #49's own `make verify` in CI compares against the merge base.
4. **Patches 6 and 6b (contract-check in verify)**, after #49. Both #49 and patch 6 edit `agent-kit.conf` (lines 25 and 29 are four lines apart, so the contexts may touch): re-run the apply check after #49 and regenerate patch 6 if it fails. If #75's lint target has landed by then, wire the check there instead of `LINT_CMD`.
5. **#80** (Engineer, QA): harden `make backend-run` and `make backend-stop` (a `Makefile` change). It moves the epoch (roadmap line 39 is out of date, see Notes). It must land before #22.
6. **Patch 7 (`KIT_VERSION` to `1.10+socboard.2`)**, then `make kit-check`, then the epoch-start record (new record after `_docs/records/2026-11-10T1506Z-measure-ponytail-epoch-1-start.md`, naming the base commit and the items above). Then claim the next counted issue (#12).

Why this gives one move: steps 1 to 5 each change what a role runs or reads, but no counted issue runs between step 1 and step 6, and the new epoch is recorded once, at step 6, with the final commit as its base.

Not drafted here: #63, #49, #65 and #80 are Engineer issues; their texts are not part of this batch.

## Still open for the human

1. Read the exact diffs of items 3 and 4 at landing (wording is the PM's).
2. Say whether the doc edits (step 2) go before or after #65, #49 and #80.
3. Before landing 6: run `make contract-check` and `make verify BASE=origin/main` in the dev container.
