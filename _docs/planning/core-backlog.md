# Core backlog (issue drafts)

Pre-issue drafts for Roadmap 1: Core. Each becomes one tracker issue via the PM/grooming process; acceptance criteria then live on the issue (this file is the source the PM works from, not the canonical home). Shape follows `_docs/agent-kit/templates/task-template.md`. Requirements and invariants: `_docs/specs.md`.

This file exists because the sandbox can't create issues directly. Once issues are filed, the roadmap's numbered list carries the live order and this file can be archived.

## 1. Scaffold the stack
**Why:** Nothing is built yet and the stack is unchosen; building can't start until the skeleton exists and the choice is approved.
**Goal:** Approved stack, empty-but-running backend + frontend, `make run` placeholder.
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Human has approved `_docs/decisions/20261105T133030Z-stack-choice.md` (or recorded a different choice).
- [ ] `backend/` (FastAPI) and `frontend/` (React+TS) skeletons exist; backend serves a health endpoint.
- [ ] `make run` starts the stack locally; `make test` runs an empty-but-green suite.
**Constraints:** No business logic yet. Stay inside the approved stack. Don't add a DB engine beyond SQLite without a new decision.

## 2. Data model + migrations
**Why:** Every later feature reads/writes the same entities; the audit trail and single-owner rule depend on the shape being right first.
**Goal:** Schema for alerts, cases, assignments, notes, audit entries, and users.
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Entities: `alert` (source, type, asset, asset_criticality, timestamp, severity), `case` (status, closing_reason nullable, current_owner nullable), `assignment` (case, user, at), `note` (case, author, text, at), `audit_entry` (case, actor, action, detail, at), `user` (name, role, password_hash).
- [ ] A case references exactly one alert; `current_owner` is nullable and single-valued (enforces one-owner-at-a-time at the data layer).
- [ ] `closing_reason` is required only when status is `Closed` (checked in app logic; see #8).
- [ ] Migrations run via a make target; schema is database-agnostic (no SQLite-only types).
**Constraints:** SQLAlchemy models. No ML. Keep severity a stored, explainable value set by #5, never inferred.

## 3. Seeded minimal auth
**Why:** Ownership, reassignment, and the audit trail are meaningless without a known actor.
**Goal:** Seeded Analyst and Lead accounts; bearer-token login.
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Seed creates one Analyst and one Lead with hashed passwords (no plaintext in code, logs, or telemetry).
- [ ] `POST /login` returns a bearer token; protected endpoints reject missing/invalid tokens with a clear 401.
- [ ] The current user's identity and role are available to every write path (for audit + role checks).
**Constraints:** Minimal — no signup, SSO, or password reset. Follow the auth pattern from `_docs/planning/02_development-example.md`.

## 4. Ingest API
**Why:** Alerts must enter the system before anything else works.
**Goal:** `POST /alerts` accepts a synthetic alert and persists it.
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Accepts source, type, affected asset, timestamp; validates required fields and rejects malformed input with a clear error.
- [ ] Persists the alert and creates its case in status `New`.
- [ ] Alert text fields are stored raw but are escaped wherever later rendered; a payload containing markup/script is stored and later shown inert (verified in #6 view). An ingest attempt treating alert text as instructions is refused by design (text is data only).
- [ ] Ingest writes an audit entry (`ingested`).
**Constraints:** Synthetic data only. Don't trigger scoring here beyond calling #5's scorer.

## 5. Rule-based scoring
**Why:** Consistent, explainable priority is the core value; it must not be ML.
**Goal:** A fixed severity table maps (type × asset_criticality) → severity.
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] An explicit table/dict defines severity for each (type, asset_criticality) pair; an unknown pair falls back to a documented default.
- [ ] Severity is deterministic and unit-tested for representative pairs including the fallback.
- [ ] The rule that produced a severity is recoverable (stored or trivially re-derivable) so it can be explained.
- [ ] No ML, no randomness in the scoring path.
**Constraints:** Keep the table small but non-trivial. Changing it needs spec/issue approval (it is a product rule).

## 6. Queue API + UI
**Why:** The queue is the analyst's main surface and the "appears within N seconds" behavior lives here.
**Goal:** A sorted, polling queue of open alerts.
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] `GET /queue` returns open cases sorted by severity (highest first) then age (oldest first).
- [ ] The UI lists the queue and refreshes by polling; a newly ingested alert appears within the target latency N (set N here and in the spec; default 5s).
- [ ] Alert text renders escaped/inert (closes the XSS case from #4).
- [ ] Each row shows severity, type, asset, age, and owner (or unclaimed).
**Constraints:** Polling, not WebSockets (see decision record). Keep the poll interval configurable.

## 7. Claim + single-owner
**Why:** "Nobody knows who owns an alert" is a core problem; one owner at a time fixes it.
**Goal:** An analyst claims an open case and becomes its sole owner.
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] `POST /cases/{id}/claim` sets `current_owner` to the caller only if currently unowned; a second claim is refused with a clear error.
- [ ] Claiming writes an assignment row and an audit entry (`claimed`).
- [ ] The queue/case view reflects the owner immediately after the next poll.
**Constraints:** One owner at a time is enforced server-side, not just in the UI.

## 8. Workflow transitions
**Why:** The defined workflow and blocked-transition errors are explicit product behavior.
**Goal:** `New → Investigating → Closed` with a required reason and rejected illegal moves.
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Legal transitions: New→Investigating, Investigating→Closed. All others (e.g. New→Closed, Closed→anything) are refused with a clear error and never silently applied.
- [ ] Closing requires a reason in {true positive, false positive, duplicate}; closing without one is refused.
- [ ] Only the owner (or a Lead) can transition a case.
- [ ] Every transition writes an audit entry (`status_changed`, with from/to and reason).
**Constraints:** Transitions and reasons are product rules; changing them needs spec approval.

## 9. Notes
**Why:** Investigation history must be captured.
**Goal:** Analysts add notes to a case they are working.
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] `POST /cases/{id}/notes` appends a note with author and timestamp; empty notes refused.
- [ ] Notes render escaped/inert (untrusted text).
- [ ] Adding a note writes an audit entry (`note_added`).
- [ ] Notes are readable in chronological order on the case.
**Constraints:** Flat notes (no threading) for Core.

## 10. Audit trail
**Why:** "No record of what happened" is a core problem; the trail is the fix and a rubric observability asset.
**Goal:** A case's full history is readable in order.
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] `GET /cases/{id}/audit` returns every entry (ingest, claim, status change, note, assignment) in chronological order with who/what/when.
- [ ] The case view renders the trail start-to-finish.
- [ ] No credentials or secrets ever appear in audit entries.
**Constraints:** Append-only; audit entries are never edited or deleted.

## 11. Tests + one-command run
**Why:** The rubric rewards unit + integration tests that run with one command, and single-command local run.
**Goal:** Green unit + integration suites and a working `make run`.
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Unit tests cover scoring (#5), transition rules (#8), and single-owner (#7).
- [ ] Integration tests cover the two primary journeys end to end (ingest→queue, claim→investigate→close with audit).
- [ ] `make test` runs everything and passes; `make verify` passes.
- [ ] `make run` brings up frontend + backend + DB locally.
**Constraints:** Tests must be meaningful (no weakened/trivial assertions; `make verify` guards this).

## Deferred (not Core — see spec §6–7)
- Synthetic alert generator (Should) and Lead reassignment (Should) — pull into Core only if time allows, else first Target Enhancements.
- Observability / alerting / on-call agent — devops process.
- Deployment to a public URL + CI/CD — deployment + devops processes.
- LangGraph advisory triage, n8n, MCP/VulnTriage — Target Enhancements.
